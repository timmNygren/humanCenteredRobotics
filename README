Running this program.

***THIS RUNS ON UNIX ONLY FOR DIRECTORY ACCESS***

First run make to build all programs, this should produce executables called star, joint_displace, and hod(**failed**)
(Submission required final datafiles, they are already generated)

To run star using default values:
./star dataset/train/ dataset/test/

The two parameters must be directories

For further testing, there are options available that allow the user to change
parameters of the histograms and joints used for the star skeleton. 

To see the available options, run:

./star


To run hjpd using default values:
./joint_displace dataset/train/ dataset/test/

The two parameters must be directories

For further testing, there are some options available that allow the user to change
the lower and upper bounds of the histograms, the number of bins in a histogram, and/or the
reference joint used in calculating the position differences.

To see the available options, run:
./joint_displace


To run hod:
./trajectories dataset/train/ dataset/test/

One option is available with hod. You can specify the number of bins using:
./trajectories -b <#> dataset/train/ dataset/test/



If you want to clean the final data files, run: make fileClean

****************************** 
**	      Evaluating        **
******************************

*** The easy.py script looks for gnuplot in /usr/local/bin/gnuplot ****

Scripts provided: 
	in /nygren-Project2-Code - move_files.sh 		(moves generated files (i.e. rad/rad.t) to libsvm/tools)
	in libsvm-3.18/tools/	 - run_all.sh 			(run_all runs easy.py with libsvm files)
							 - cleanDir.sh   		(cleanDir removes all variations of rad*, hjpd*, and hod*)
							 - confusionMatrix.sh 	(generates confusion matrices given options)

use the commands below to evaluate the created data files:

From the root directory, nygren-Project2-Code, run the move_files.sh

./move_files.sh 

This will move any {rad, rad.t}, {hjpd, hjpd.t}, and {hod, hod.t} files to libsvm-3.18/tools/

Then move to the tools directory in the libsvm

cd libsvm-3.18/tools/

Use the script run_all to run the easy python script on each pair of rad/t, hjpd/t, hod/t files
./run_all

To run each individually:
./easy rad rad.t
./easy hjpd hjpd.t
./easy hod hod.t

After running the data file through the svm, you can run ./confusionMatrix.py -a to output a
confusion matrix for each dataset. You can also run ./confusionMatrix.py without args to view
other options to run a confusion matrix individually.
